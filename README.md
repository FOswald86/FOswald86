I am a dedicated student pursuing a degree in computer science at the Eveningschool of the HTL Mössingerstraße. With a passion for technology and a curiosity for exploring the digital world, I am committed to gaining a deep understanding of computer systems, programming languages, and innovative software development. I thrive in the dynamic and ever-evolving field of information technology, and I am excited to contribute my skills and knowledge to the advancement of digital solutions.

During my studies, I have taken on projects that not only challenged my coding skills but also demanded strategic thinking and problem-solving abilities. My recent project involved developing an online scheduling system for service providers that incorporates Business Intelligence elements to facilitate data-driven decisions, enhancing efficiency and service quality across various industries.
